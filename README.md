Campus Parking System 
The Campus Parking System is a comprehensive Android application designed to streamline and automate parking management within educational institutions. This solution addresses the challenges of limited parking space allocation, security monitoring, and administrative oversight through a multi-role platform.

The application features three distinct user interfaces: a user dashboard for students and faculty to book parking slots and submit parking requests; an admin dashboard for managing parking slots, approving requests, and configuring reserved spaces; and a security dashboard for monitoring vehicle entry/exit, enforcing speed limits, and reporting violations.

Key functionalities include real-time parking slot availability tracking, document verification for vehicle registration, violation management with automated penalty application, and a guest pass system for temporary visitors. The application implements zone-based parking allocation, allowing users to select preferred parking areas across campus.

Security features include vehicle scanning with simulated OCR technology, violation reporting, and automated slot release for overstayed vehicles. The system also maintains comprehensive records of all parking activities, violations, and user bookings, enabling data-driven decision-making for campus parking management.

Built with modern Android development practices using Kotlin, the application employs SQLite for local data persistence and follows material design principles for an intuitive user experience. The modular architecture ensures scalability and maintainability, making it adaptable to various campus environments and requirements.
